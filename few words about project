I created branch Vytrack for our assignment Vytrack, let's put all that information in that branch

When Nadir will give us smthg another, not a Vytrack, somebody of us can create new branch etc

Just let's collaborate and do it together,with a lot of comments and commits, because everybody have problems with GitHub,
so we have to pay extra attention what all members of our group are doing here and how we are dong that -> so we can stop and
fix everything in the very begining or ask somebody to explain some part
